Before we get to the details, here are a few of our fundamental privacy principles:

Lighthouse is a social platform and information you upload or post to Lighthouse may be publicly viewable and searchable by Lighthouse members and non-members.
We aggregate certain information about our members’ use of the Services for business purposes and we sometimes publish that information or share it with others.
We give you several ways to control what information is shared with others and the public and are continuously working to enhance privacy options available to you.

Our privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) explains the information we collect, how we use and share it, how to manage your privacy controls and your rights in connection with the Services. Please also read our Terms of Service which sets out the terms governing the Services.

Lighthouse is headquartered in Salt Lake City and our Services are provided to you by Lighthouse. 

This policy was written in English. To the extent a translated version conflicts with the English version, the English version controls. Unless indicated otherwise, this Privacy Policy does not apply to third party products or services or the practices of companies that we do not own or control, including other companies you might interact with on or through the Services.

We Collect, Use, Share and Otherwise Process Information

Lighthouse relies on a number of legal bases to collect, use, share, and otherwise process the information we have about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including:
as necessary to provide the Services and fulfill our obligations pursuant to the Terms of Service. 

For example, we cannot provide the Services unless we collect and use your location information; where you have consented to the processing; where necessary to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise and defend legal claims; to protect your vital interests, or those of others, such as in the case of emergencies; where you have made the information public; and where necessary for the purposes of Lighthouse’s or a third party’s legitimate interests, such as our interests in protecting our members, our partners’ interests in collaborating with our members, and our commercial interests in ensuring the sustainability of the Services.

Information Lighthouse Collects

Lighthouse collects information about you, including information that directly or indirectly identifies you, if you or your other members choose to share it with Lighthouse. We receive information in a few different ways, including when you track, complete or upload activities using the Services. Lighthouse also collects information about how you use the Services. There are also several opportunities for you to share information about yourself, your friends, and your activities with Lighthouse. 

For example:

We collect basic account information such as your name, email address, username and password that helps secure and provide you with access to our Services.

Profile, activity and use information is collected about you when you choose to upload a picture, activity (including date, time and geo-location information view others’ activities, or otherwise use the Services.

How Lighthouse Uses Information

Lighthouse uses the information we collect and receive to administer and operate the Services and to customize them for you. Subject to your privacy controls, your information, including your profile, username, photos, and your activities will be shared on Lighthouse so that you may be able to participate in the Services. Your precise location information, may also be shared on Lighthouse, in accordance with your privacy controls.

We use the information we collect about you  and your activities to customize your experience. We also use the information we collect to provide support related to the Services, protect members and enforce our Terms of Service, promote safety,

We also use the information we collect to analyze, develop and improve the Services. To do this, Lighthouse may use third party analytics providers to gain insights into how our Services are used and to help us improve the Services.

We may also use the information we collect to market and promote the Services, activities on Lighthouse, and other commercial products or services. This includes customizing your Lighthouse experience.  
Lighthouse may aggregate the information you and others make available in connection with the Services and post it publicly or share it with third parties. To do this, we remove certain account information, such as your name, and combine the resulting information with similar information from other Lighthouse users. Examples of the type of information we may aggregate in this way include information about demographics, location patterns, and location information. Lighthouse may use, sell, license, and share this information with third parties for research, business or other purposes to help our partners understand more about athletes, including the people who use their products and services. Lighthouse also uses aggregated data to generate our Global Heatmap. Please visit your privacy controls if you object to Lighthouse using your information for these purposes. 

Because the data we aggregate comes from activities, information, and content you shared on the Services and which is identified with your Lighthouse user name among other information, someone looking at both this information you’ve shared and also the global heatmap, could draw a potential connection.

How Information is Shared

In addition to sharing aggregated data about our members as described above, we also share information that identifies you in accordance with your preferences, as needed to run our business and provide the Services, and where required for legal purposes, as set forth below.

Service Providers

We may share your information with third parties who provide services to Lighthouse such as supporting and improving the Services, promoting the Services.

For example, all or a portion of your name and other profile information is viewable by other Lighthouse members and, subject to your privacy controls, additional information you provide may also be viewable.
